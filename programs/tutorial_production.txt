Each player starts with a base with 100 HP
If a player's base reaches 0 HP, they are removed from the game.
The last player remaining is the winner!


PRODUCTION
Each turn you may produce: 
Cost $5 Army-(attack/defend unit
Cost $1 Workers-(Collect 1 gold tax per turn from them)
Cost $3 Factories - (The number of workers/armies/factories you can produce each turn is equal to the amount of factories you started the turn with)
Cost $3 Spy - Espionage unit
To produce you must enter the amount you want to SPEND
Production will round down if you enter a non-multiple value
For example, you want to produce armies, and you say that you would like to spend $9
That will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $5 (the cost of an army), and you will only be charged $5



ATTACK/ESPIONAGE
When attacking the defender has a 3 army defensive base bonus
If the attackers army overwhelms the defender, they may chose to target the defenders base or the defenders workers/production
Players may espionage other players at a cost of 2 spies to see the other players full stats, or 1 worker for each individual stat


RANDOM EVENTS
If you choose to activate random events, random events will happen!
These events may greatly imbalance the game.
Enjoy!
