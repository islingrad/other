##Write a function remove-duplicates that consumes a list of numbers, and produces the same
##list, with all but the last occurrence of each number removed. For example, if the input
##was the list 1; 3; 1; 2; 4; 2; 7; 2; 5, the output would be the list 3; 1; 4; 7; 2; 5. The order of the
##elements in the input list needs to be maintained in the output list, as shown in the example.
##Place your solution in the file duplicates.rkt.

inp = [1,3,1,2,4,2,7,2,5]
def duplicates(inp):
    holds = []
    dupes = []
    for i in inp:
        if i not in holds:
            holds.append(i)
        elif i in holds:
            dupes.append(i)
    for i in dupes:
        locate = inp.index(i)
        del inp[locate]
    return inp
print duplicates(inp)
